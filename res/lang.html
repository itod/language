<h2>Language</h2>

<p>KonsolSkript is a simple, dynamic, interpreted language designed for use in the Grafik Konsol application. KonsolSkript is implemented in Objective-C using a Test-Driven Development style (it has decent test coverage) and is <a href="https://github.com/itod/Language">open-source</a>.</p>

<p>KonsolSkript is heavily influenced by several popular languages, including Python, JavaScript and XPath.</p>

<p>KonsolSkript is object-based (everthing is an Object), but not (yet) object-oriented – there is no <code>class</code> construct available to users.</p>

<p>KonsolSkript features functions using the <code>sub</code> construct (short for subroutine). Functions are first-class objects as in Python or JavaScript, and may be treated like any other variable. A function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.</p>

<h2>Types</h2>

<h3>Object</h3>

<p>Abstract base class of all objects in KonsolSkript.</p>

<h3>null</h3>

<p>This type has a single value. There is a single object with this value. This object is accessed through the built-in name <code>null</code>. It is used to signify the absence of a value in many situations, e.g., it is returned from functions that don’t explicitly return anything. Its truth value is false.</p>

<h3>Boolean</h3>

<p>An object of type Boolean can have one of two values, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>An <code>or</code> expression is evaluated by evaluating each operand and converting its value to a Boolean as if by a call to the <code><a href="#fn-Boolean">Boolean</a></code> function. The result is true if either value is true and false otherwise. The right operand is not evaluated if the left operand evaluates to true.</p>

<p>An <code>and</code> expression is evaluated by evaluating each operand and converting its value to a Boolean as if by a call to the <code><a href="#fn-Boolean">Boolean</a></code> function. The result is true if both values are true and false otherwise. The right operand is not evaluated if the left operand evaluates to false.</p>

<p>An EqualityExpr (that is not just a RelationalExpr) or a RelationalExpr (that is not just an AdditiveExpr) is evaluated by comparing the objects that result from evaluating the two operands.</p>

<p>When the operator is <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code> or <code>&gt;</code>, then the objects are compared by converting both objects to numbers and comparing the numbers according to IEEE 754. The <code>&lt;</code> comparison will be true if and only if the first number is less than the second number. The <code>&lt;=</code> comparison will be true if and only if the first number is less than or equal to the second number. The <code>&gt;</code> comparison will be true if and only if the first number is greater than the second number. The <code>&gt;=</code> comparison will be true if and only if the first number is greater than or equal to the second number.</p>


<h3>Number</h3>

<p>A number represents a floating-point number. A number can have any double-precision 64-bit format IEEE 754 value. These include a special "Not-a-Number" (<code>NaN</code>) value, positive and negative infinity, and positive and negative zero.</p>

<p>There are three different ways to represent a Number literal. All three types allow underscore separator chars (<code>_</code>) anywhere within the Number literal – these can be used to enhance readability but have no effect on the literal value.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p><i>Decimal</i> Number literals consist of an optionally signed sequence of digits with an optional decimal point and fractional part.</p>
        <pre>
    42
    -280
    3.14
    47.
    1_000_000
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i>Hexadecimal</i> Number literals consist of an octothorpe (<code>#</code>) followed by a sequence of case-insensitive hexadecimal digits (<code>0-9</code>, <code>A-F</code> or <code>a-f</code>).</p>
        <pre>
    #FFFFFF
    #00CC77
    #00_CC_77
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i>Binary</i> Number literals consist of a dollar sign (<code>$</code>) followed by a sequence of binary digits (<code>0-1</code>).</p>
        <pre>
    $1111
    $0101_0000
        </pre>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The numeric operators convert their operands to numbers as if by calling the <code><a href="#fn-Number">Number</a></code> function.</p>

<p>The <code>+</code> operator performs addition.</p>

<p>The <code>-</code> operator performs subtraction.</p>

<p>The <code>/</code> operator performs floating-point division according to IEEE 754.</p>

<p>The % operator returns the remainder from a truncating division. For example,</p>

<pre>
     5 %  2  // 1
     5 % -2  // 1
    -5 %  2  // -1
    -5 % -2  // -1
</pre>

<p>NOTE: This is the same as the <code>%</code> operator in Java and ECMAScript.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is not the same as the IEEE 754 remainder operation, which returns the remainder from a rounding division.</p>

<h3>String</h3>

<p>A String is a sequence of values that represent Unicode code points. All the code points in the range <code>U+0000 - U+10FFFF</code> can be represented in a String. The built-in function <code><a href="#fn-ord">ord()</a></code> converts a code point from its String form to an integer in the range <code>0 - 10FFFF</code>; <code><a href="#fn-chr">chr()</a></code> converts an integer in the range <code>0 - 10FFFF</code> to the corresponding length 1 String object.</p>

<p>More documentation is obviously needed here, but KonsolSkript is implemented in Objective-C, so various features of KS String objects will obviously mirror aspects of <code>NSString</code> from Objective-C.</p>

<h3>Array</h3>

<p>KonsolSkript Arrays are virtually identical to Arrays in Python, with two important differences:</p>

<ul>
    <li>KonsolSkript Arrays are 1-index based (like XPath), not 0-index based (like Python).</li>
    <li>The following syntax (borrowed from PHP) is used for appending an object to an Array in KS:
    <pre>
    var a = ['x'] // create array
    a[] = 'y'     // appends 'y'
    a[] = 'z'     // appends 'z'
    print(a)      // ['x', 'y', 'z']
</pre>
    </li>
    
</ul>

<p>Python-style Array slicing is fully supported in KonsolSkript Arrays (again, with the difference that KS Arrays are 1-index based).</p>

<pre>
    // …continued from above
    print(a)      // ['x', 'y', 'z']
    print(a[1])   // 'x'
    print(a[2])   // 'y'
    print(a[-1])  // 'z'
    print(a[-2])  // 'y'
    print(a[:])   // ['x', 'y', 'z']
    print(a[:1])  // 'x'
    print(a[3:])  // 'z'
    print(a[1:2]) // ['x', 'y']
</pre>

<h3>Dictionary</h3>

<p>KonsolSkript Dictionaries are virtually identical to Dictionaries in Python, with the exception that accessing a key which is not present in the Dictionary returns <code>null</code> rather than throwing an exception.</p>

<pre>
    var d = {'foo': 1}
    d['bar'] = 2
    print(d)        // {'foo': 1, 'bar': 2}
    print(d['baz']) // null
</pre>

<h3>Function</h3>

<p>Functions are first class objects in KonsolSkript.</p>

<pre>

sub add(a, b) {
    return a + b
}

add(2, 4) // 6

var f = add

f(3, 5) // 8

var div = sub (a, b) {
    return a / b
}

div(4, 2) // 2
</pre>
